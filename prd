I asked you and grok to think about pressing a button in ubuntu in speech to text.

Can you build the code for this? Button press detection, speech to text, insert at cursor once I let go of hotkey

The user wants me to help build a code on Ubuntu that listens for a hotkey: while the key is pressed, it captures speech, and once released, transcribes that into text and inserts it at the cursor position. I need to detect the hotkey, start audio capture, stop when the key is released, transcribe with services like Pocketsphinx or Whisper, and finally simulate keystrokes to insert the text at the cursor. I’ll write the code based on this flow.

I should provide the entire Python script for the user. To capture the hotkey and start/stop recording audio, I can use libraries like pynput (for key events) and pyaudio or sounddevice (for audio recording). For transcription, I can leverage OpenAI's Whisper model (or use Vosk for offline), depending on whether they prefer a remote or local solution. Code will be placed in the canvas for easier editing, and I’ll include instructions on installation. I’ll give a detailed explanation of each step in the final explanation.

Speech To Text Hotkey

I dropped a complete Python script into the canvas for you. It:

listens for F8 (press = start recording, release = stop & transcribe)

calls Whisper through the OpenAI API (swap in another engine if you prefer)

“types” the recognized text right where your cursor is

quits cleanly with Esc

Take a look and let me know if you’d like tweaks—different hot-key, offline recognizer, Wayland notes, etc. Happy coding!

I've replaced the script with a new version that gracefully falls back to an FFmpeg-based recorder when PortAudio (or the entire sounddevice module) is missing. The tests verify both the WAV helper round-trip and dynamic backend selection.

Give this a spin—let me know if you hit anything else or would like more tweaks!
